// =>The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

// =>The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing the current function. 
// =>If the function is not a method of an object, then this refers to the global object.



// This function is not a method of an object, so `this` refers to the global object.
